## What is it?

**Python** is a Programming language that is **interpreted, object-oriented, and considered to be high-level too**. Python is one of the easiest yet most useful programming languages which is widely used in the software industry. People use Python for **Competitive Programming, Web Development, and creating software**. Due to its **easiest syntax**, it is recommended for beginners who are new to the software engineering field. Its demand is growing at a very rapid pace due to its vast use cases in Modern Technological fields like **Data Science, Machine learning, and Automation Tasks**. For many years now, it has been ranked among the top Programming languages.

## Main Features
Here are just a few of the things that Python does well:

  - **Free and Open Source** [**Download-Python**][Download-Python] (It is freely available at the official website and you can download it from the given download link below click on         the Download Python keyword. Download Python Since it is open-source, this means that source code is also available to the public. So you can download it, use it as well as share 
      it.
    
  - **Easy to code**
      Python is a  [**high-level programming language**][ high-level programming language]. Python is very easy to learn the language as compared to other languages like C, C#, Javascript, Java, etc. It is very easy to code in the Python language and anybody can learn Python basics in a few hours or days. It is also a developer-friendly language.

  - **Easy to Read**
      As you will see, learning Python is quite simple. As was already established, Pythonâ€™s syntax is really straightforward. The code block is defined by the indentations rather than        by semicolons

  -  **Python is a Portable language**
Python language is also a portable language. For example, if we have Python code for Windows and if we want to run this code on other platforms such as Linux, Unix, and Mac then we do not need to change it, we can run this code on any platform.

  - **Interpreted Language** 
Python is an Interpreted Language because Python code is executed line by line at a time. like other languages C, C++, Java, etc. there is no need to compile Python code this makes it easier to debug our code. The source code of Python is converted into an immediate form called bytecode.
